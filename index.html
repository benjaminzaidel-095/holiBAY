  <h2>Game Overview</h2>
  <p class="rules-text">
    After dinner at China Live, Migs (the chicken) and Sara go ahead and post up at one bar on the map with the tab.
    Everyone else splits into hunter teams and starts searching the map bars to find them.
  </p>

  <h3>Map</h3>
  <ul class="rules-list">
    <li>The hunt map is fixed for the night: Li Po Lounge, Vesuvio Café, Maggie’s, Tupelo, Legacy, April Jean, Devil’s Acre, The Lucky Spot, and The Saloon.</li>
    <li>Migs may only sit or move between bars on this list.</li>
    <li>Hunters may only search bars on this list. Anything else is off-map and does not count.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Migs &amp; Sara (Chicken Team)</h3>
  <ul class="rules-list">
    <li>Pick a starting bar on the map and stay put to start. You control the tab.</li>
    <li>You may move at most once every 30 minutes, except for a single Stealth Move (see below).</li>
    <li>If hunters get clear photo evidence of Migs outside between bars, he must immediately enter the nearest bar, buy a shot, and send a selfie as proof.</li>
    <li>Before the game, quietly choose one bar as your “safe bar.” If Migs sits there for 45 uninterrupted minutes without being found, that counts as one successful escape.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Migs Movement &amp; Stealth</h3>
  <ul class="rules-list">
    <li>Normal moves: after leaving dinner, Migs may only change bars on a ~30 minute timer (earlier if everyone agrees the clock has clearly passed).</li>
    <li>Stealth Move: once per night, Migs may move early (before the 30-minute mark). After this, the normal 30-minute rule resumes.</li>
    <li>When Migs moves, he should not announce it directly. Hunters infer movement from time and hints.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Hints &amp; Lies</h3>
  <ul class="rules-list">
    <li>Roughly every 30 minutes, Migs must send one hint to the group chat. It can be about what he sees, hears, or the general vibe.</li>
    <li>Migs gets at most two lies for the entire night. Every other hint must be broadly true.</li>
    <li>Hints can be ambiguous, cropped photos, or partial details, but outright fabrications beyond the two allowed lies are not in play.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Hunters</h3>
  <ul class="rules-list">
    <li>Hunters break into one or two teams. Each team can use this site on one phone to track their own Bingo and visited bars.</li>
    <li>At each step, a team picks a bar on the map, walks in, and checks if Migs is there.</li>
    <li>If Migs is there, the hunt portion is over and the group can collapse to that bar and/or call an endgame however you want.</li>
    <li>If Migs is not there: that team must buy and finish a drink in that bar before leaving. For that team, that bar is now “burned” unless they have a very clear reason to believe he has moved back later.</li>
    <li>Use the Map tab to toggle bars as “Visited / burned” for your team so you do not accidentally loop the same wrong bar all night.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Outside Catches &amp; Penalties</h3>
  <ul class="rules-list">
    <li>If a hunter team spots Migs outside between bars and can provide photo evidence, that is an “outside catch.”</li>
    <li>On an outside catch, Migs must immediately enter the nearest bar, buy a shot, and send a selfie as proof.</li>
    <li>Outside catches do not end the hunt by themselves, but they are brutal for Migs and feed directly into Bingo squares.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Bingo Layer</h3>
  <ul class="rules-list">
    <li>The Bingo card tracks meaningful game events: burned bars, bad hints, outside catches, safe-bar escapes, and endgame chaos.</li>
    <li>Each team should treat their card as a team card, not individual. One card per team.</li>
    <li>Hard rule: at most one square can be ticked per bar visit for your team, and only when that event actually occurs.</li>
    <li>When your team completes a full row, column, or diagonal, hit “I got Bingo” on your device. That logs the win to the host leaderboard on that phone.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Win Conditions (Soft)</h3>
  <ul class="rules-list">
    <li>Hunters “win” the hunt by finding Migs in a bar on the map.</li>
    <li>Migs “wins” on survival if he stacks enough time and escapes: surviving multiple 30-minute windows without being found and/or completing a full 45-minute safe-bar sit without detection.</li>
    <li>Bingo is a separate flex: teams race to complete lines based on how much chaos and bad decision-making the night produces.</li>
    <li>Formal scoring is optional. You can treat the leaderboard as bragging rights and rely on memory and photos to argue about who actually played it best.</li>
  </ul>
